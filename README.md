​🚀 Key Features
​Sticky Navigation Architecture: Implemented a persistent dark header using position: sticky and nested Flexbox to ensure brand visibility and CTA accessibility during scrolling.
​Mobile-First Design: Optimized for all screen sizes with custom media queries that prevent content "shrinkage" and maintain full-width legibility.
​UX-Focused Interaction: Enhanced accessibility with large touch targets (1.2rem+ font size) and optimized button padding for a seamless mobile shopping experience.
​🛠️ Technical Challenges & Solutions
​1. Header Layout Alignment
​Challenge: On mobile, the logo and navigation links were overlapping and difficult to read.
Solution: Re-engineered the header using flex-direction: column for stacking and flex-wrap: wrap to allow the "Order Now" button to sit cleanly beneath the navigation links.
​2. Content Column Scaling
​Challenge: The "Our Story" and "Subscription" sections appeared as thin, shrunken columns on mobile devices.
Solution: Overrode desktop grid layouts with specific mobile media queries to force a vertical stack, allowing the text to occupy the full screen width for maximum readability.
